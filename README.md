# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT
One of the most important aspects if not the most important in being a company that provides service and works in this area of industry is being able to spot their target consumers. In our project, we tackle this spesfic concern by using a dataset about a bike sharing company located at Washington DC. Bike sharing system is basically a service for people to rent and use bikes for some time in exchange for a fee. The data set consist of information such as weather variables, rental hours, number of bikes rented, their users, etc. To cover such topic, we plan to focus on the area of usage, more spesifically, weather people use the bikes as a hobby or for transportation. The answer to this question is crucial to such a company as it will allow the firm to more easily and efficiently spot and act upon their target customers. We plan to classify the rental hours and weather conditions after cleaning and sorting the data with respect to rental hours in order to monitor the working hours and the purpose of use. In the end of our work, we finally aim to be able to pinpoint the future costumer behaviours as well as estimation of demand for bike with the help of previous data.
This project was created for Data Science Course in SabancÄ± University as a group.
